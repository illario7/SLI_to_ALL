# SLI_to_ALL
Trying to enable SLI on everything. 
I've tried to turn on SLI support on 32 bit 
win7+ drivers, since hyper SLI and differentSLIauto
are dead. 
I did it to enable SLI on 2x7900gs on dual 
pentium 3 platform. I've been changed 307.74
32 bit driver and it had worked! 

The debug information on 307.74 32bit
is located in file:result_307_74_x86.txt
Otherwise for64 bit:result_307_74_x64.txt
